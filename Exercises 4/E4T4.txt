1. What additional architectural change can be made to reduce the
   internet-facing attack surface of the web application instance?
- Config Load Balancer to redirect all HTTP requests to HTTPS.
- Use NAT gateway and move instance to private subnet.
- Add WAF to prevent common security attacks.
- Prevent DDOS attack with AWS Shield.

2. Assuming the IAM permissions for the S3 bucket are still insecure, would
   creating VPC private endpoints for S3 prevent the unauthorized access to the
   secrets bucket?
Not really, because moving S3 to private VPC can only prevent the traffic from outside VPC.
If we manage IAM permissions incorrectly, unauthorized access risks are still there.

3. Will applying default encryption setting to the s3 buckets encrypt the data that already exists?
No, the new settings will not be applied for existed data. We have to encrypt all the files again too.

4. The changes you made above were done through the console or CLI; describe the outcome if the original cloud formation templates are applied to this environment?
The CloudFormation templates with override all the changes we made through console or CLI.
