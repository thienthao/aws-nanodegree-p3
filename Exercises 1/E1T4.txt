- Poor practice 1
Current ACL rules of public and private subnet network are allowing all access on all ports from all ports.

-> ACL rules should provide access for neccessary parties only. We shouldn't make attacker's life becomes easier, minimize the probability of malicious actions just by config ACL rules.

- Poor practice 2
Current policy of this instance is allowing application server to access to all S3 buckets.

-> The same principle above should be applied on this case. We should open access to only needed bucket for application server.
